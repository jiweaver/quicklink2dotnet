Description: This is a very simple .NET wrapper (in C#) for EyeTech's QuickLink API.  The QuickLink API can be used by developers to control EyeTech's line of eye trackers.  The QuickLink API is provided by EyeTech's QuickGlance software, which can be obtained from their website (http://eyetechds.com).  The API wrapper uses .NET's Interop Services to call QuickLink's unmanaged DLLs.  Note that 64bit QuickLink support is still untested!

See "QuickLinkAPI4NET\QuickLinkAPI4NET\QuickLink.cs" for the API wrapper methods.

See "QuickLinkExample\QuickLinkExample\Form1.cs" for an example of how to use the API wrapper in your code.
